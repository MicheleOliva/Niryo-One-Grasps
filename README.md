# Niryo One as a Vision-Based Robotic Grasping System - Computer Engineering Master's Degree @ UNISA

## Description

Project developed as part of the thesis in Computer Engineering Master's Degree at Universit√† Degli Studi di Salerno.

The project consisted in designing, implementing and testing a real robotic system controlled by an embedded platform that can perform object-independent grasp synthesis and execution.

All the packages are released with the GPLv3 license except the ```aruco_detector``` package, to develop this package has been necessary the use of the BSD licensed code of @skumra and @dougsm.

## Instructions

You can find code usage instructions [here](USAGE.md).

## Documentation 

In [doc](doc.pdf), you can find an explanation of the proposed Vision-Based Robotic Grasping System.
